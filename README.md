The Student Result Management System (SRMS) is designed to streamline the process of recording, approving, and publishing academic results. It ensures every result passes through a transparent, multi-level workflow—starting from the Lecturer, through the HOD, Dean, Exams Officer, and Registrar, before being published to students.
